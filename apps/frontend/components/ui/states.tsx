/**
 * The three things a panel can be showing instead of its content: nothing yet,
 * nothing at all, or a failure.
 *
 * `DataTable` already draws all three for the rows it owns, and every screen
 * outside a table re-invented them — usually as a bare `<p>` of grey text, and
 * on the error path usually as nothing, since `logApiError` writes to the
 * console and the page keeps its stale content. These are the same three
 * states as one component so a card, a drawer and a chart panel answer "where
 * is my data" identically.
 */

/**
 * "Still loading", centred in whatever space it is given.
 *
 * Every screen wrote its own — a bare `<p>جارٍ التحميل…</p>` pinned to the
 * top-left of the content area, so a full-page wait looked like a page that had
 * rendered one line of text and stopped. Centring it is most of the fix: the
 * reader's eye is already in the middle of the region that is about to fill.
 *
 * `fullHeight` is for a screen with nothing else on it yet, where the wait
 * should sit in the middle of the viewport rather than the middle of a
 * zero-height container.
